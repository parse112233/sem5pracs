Go to the design part and remove the default service by selecting the service and click on remove button
After that click on add operation button 
-Give the operation name as "add"
-Add some variable by clicking on add and give the name of the variable and type
-Make sure that the type is "java.lang.Int" for the variable which is next to variable name and the return type as "int"

Make the same for sub, mult, divide
after that you should have four operation on the design page
Go to the webservice folder and go to your webserviceapp
and edit the return value of every function you created which is add, sub, mult, div
for example this is the mult operation function edit the return from 0 to first*second so it multiplies it

@WebMethod(operationName = "mult")
    public int mult(@WebParam(name = "first") int first, @WebParam(name = "second") int second) {
        //TODO write your implementation code here:
        return first*second;
    }

Do this for every other function
